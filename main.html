    <!-- TITLE PAGE -->
    <h1 class="center">The Codex-Lex</h1>
    <p class="center tagline">Tactical Scripture of the Order of the Codex</p>

    <p class="codex-quote center">
      "Emotion clouds judgment. Doctrine clarifies it."<br>
      "When instinct fails, procedure remains."
    </p>

    <p class="subtle center">
      Compiled under authority of the First Codicier and amended by successive commands.
      Issued to all fully inducted warriors of the Order of the Codex. This manual is to be
      carried, studied, and applied. Failure to adhere to doctrine endangers the line.
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- FOREWORD & ORIGINS -->
    <h2>Foreword and Origin of the Order</h2>

    <p>
      The Order of the Codex was not founded in peace. It was born in retreat, in the final hours
      of a collapsing front, when a scattered host of warriors and commanders realized that
      too many had died not through lack of strength, but through lack of structure. They did
      not yield for lack of courage; they yielded for lack of doctrine.
    </p>

    <p>
      What began as the field notes of a single survivor—later known as the First Codicier—evolved
      into this living document. The Codex-Lex is not a religious scripture, though some treat it
      with reverence. It is a compiled record of what keeps lines from breaking, squads from
      disintegrating, and missions from failing when conditions are hostile, chaotic, or
      catastrophically mismanaged.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the Codex-Lex includes core doctrine, recognized Edicts, standard battle
      liturgies, heraldry guidance, daily regimen, and officer conduct. Local commands may issue
      supplemental annexes, but alteration of core Articles without authorization is a
      disciplinary offense.
    </p>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "This is not a book of comfort. It is a book of survival. You are not required to like it.
      You are required to make sure the line does not break."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION I: THREE PILLARS -->
    <h2>I. The Three Pillars of Doctrine</h2>

    <p>
      All doctrinal law in the Codex-Lex rests upon three primary pillars. Violate these, and
      no amount of skill will compensate for the failure.
    </p>

    <h3>Pillar I: Discipline</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>1.1 A warrior without discipline is a liability, regardless of talent or equipment.</p>
      <p>1.2 Emotion—fear, rage, grief—may be acknowledged, but not obeyed.</p>
      <p>1.3 Discipline is the habit of correct action in the absence of supervision.</p>
      <p>1.4 Orders stand unless they directly compromise mission success or contradict Codex law.</p>
      <p>1.5 Panic is a failure of preparation. Correct the preparation, not the fear.</p>
      <p>1.6 Disobedience for personal comfort is insubordination; disobedience for mission clarity is a decision to be justified and recorded.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Pillar II: Control</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>2.1 Control your breath; erratic breathing undermines aim, judgment, and speech.</p>
      <p>2.2 Control your weapon; it is not an extension of ego, but a tool answering to doctrine.</p>
      <p>2.3 Control your position; every step changes lines of fire, cover, and exposure.</p>
      <p>2.4 Control the enemy’s options; constrain their movement, deny their favorable ground.</p>
      <p>2.5 Control your allies’ focus by issuing clear, short, executable commands.</p>
      <p>2.6 Control your own narrative after action: no excuses, only facts and corrections.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Pillar III: Purpose</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>3.1 Every action must serve an objective: tactical, operational, or strategic.</p>
      <p>3.2 Survival is important; mission completion is mandatory. The two are not always compatible.</p>
      <p>3.3 Ammunition, attention, and time are finite; squander none of them.</p>
      <p>3.4 Personal glory is irrelevant to the Codex; mission reports contain outcomes, not boasts.</p>
      <p>3.5 When in doubt, act to preserve formation integrity and the capacity to continue fighting.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Discipline without control is brutality. Control without purpose is stagnation.
      Purpose without discipline is a death charge. The Pillars exist to prevent you from being
      brave and useless."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION II: FIRST VOLLEY -->
    <h2>II. Book of the First Volley</h2>

    <p>
      The first exchange sets tempo, morale, and casualty trajectory. The First Volley is not
      a symbolic opening—it is the decisive beginning. It is the first answer to the question:
      "Who owns this battlefield?"
    </p>

    <h3>Article 4: Pre-Engagement Protocol</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>4.1 Identify and secure advantageous ground before engaging whenever possible.</p>
      <p>4.2 Conduct rapid checks: ammunition count, weapon function, sight alignment, comm signals.</p>
      <p>4.3 Assign each warrior a clearly defined sector of fire or movement responsibility.</p>
      <p>4.4 State and confirm fields of fire:
        <span class="mono">"Left arc set. Center arc set. Right arc set. Overwatch lanes established."</span>
      </p>
      <p>4.5 If surprise is compromised, preserve the First Volley for the next best opportunity; do not waste it in panic.</p>
      <p>4.6 If terrain is unfavorable and cannot be improved, acknowledge it and factor it into casualty expectations.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Article 5: Target Prioritization</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>5.1 Default priority schema (subject to situational override):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5.1.1 Command elements and force multipliers (officers, war leaders).</li>
        <li>5.1.2 Casters, artillery crews, or those capable of area devastation.</li>
        <li>5.1.3 Flanking units capable of bypassing or collapsing the line.</li>
        <li>5.1.4 Massed infantry or shock troops.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>5.2 When in doubt, ask: "Which target does the most damage to our cohesion?" and fire there.</p>
      <p>5.3 First Volley fire must be coordinated; unsynchronized firing wastes surprise and ammunition.</p>
      <p>5.4 Non-essential shots (firing without clear target or purpose) are doctrinally unacceptable.</p>
      <p>5.5 Failure of the First Volley does not excuse abandonment of doctrine; it increases the necessity for it.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "The First Volley is not a greeting. It is the first verdict."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION III: MARKED ENEMY -->
    <h2>III. Doctrine of the Marked Enemy</h2>

    <p>
      A Marked Enemy is a condemned asset—a unit chosen for focused removal. Marking is not
      a suggestion; it is a doctrinal command.
    </p>

    <h3>Article 6: Assignment of Marks</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>6.1 Only recognized leaders, Codex-trained tacticians, or those granted provisional authority may declare a Target Mark.</p>
      <p>6.2 A Mark must be declared audibly and clearly:
        <span class="mono">"Target Mark: warpriest, center ridge, one hundred paces."</span>
      </p>
      <p>6.3 Only one primary Mark per unit at a time, except under formally recognized multi-target doctrine.</p>
      <p>6.4 Contradictory or overlapping Marks are prohibited; they dilute focus and kill efficiency.</p>
      <p>6.5 Updating a Mark mid-engagement is permitted when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>6.5.1 The current Mark has been neutralized.</li>
        <li>6.5.2 The current Mark has left the engagement area.</li>
        <li>6.5.3 A higher priority threat emerges (e.g., a newly revealed spellcaster).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Article 7: Execution Against the Mark</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>7.1 Ranged assets are expected to prioritize the Mark unless immediate survival demands otherwise.</p>
      <p>7.2 Ignoring the Mark without justification is a breach of tactical obedience.</p>
      <p>7.3 Mark maintenance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>7.3.1 The Mark is maintained until removed by announcement, not assumption.</li>
        <li>7.3.2 If the Mark is obscured, update status: <span class="mono">"Mark lost. Reacquiring."</span></li>
        <li>7.3.3 If the Mark splits (illusions, duplicates), designate a primary or shift doctrine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>7.4 After-action reports must list all Marks, their duration, and kill outcomes for review.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "The Mark is the sentence. Volley and advance are the execution."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION IV: OVERWATCH -->
    <h2>IV. The Overwatch Canon</h2>

    <p>
      Overwatch is prepared violence held in reserve. It exists not to decorate the formation, but to
      punish enemy movement and protect critical vectors.
    </p>

    <h3>Article 8: Establishment of Overwatch</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>8.1 Overwatch is assigned, not volunteered for. Assignment is based on reliability and field of view.</p>
      <p>8.2 Overwatch positions must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>8.2.1 Command sightlines over enemy approaches and flanking corridors.</li>
        <li>8.2.2 Maintain clear retreat paths for themselves and nearby allies.</li>
        <li>8.2.3 Avoid clustering with priority targets to reduce optimal enemy blast zones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>8.3 Overwatch is not static; when the front shifts, overwatch must be reassessed.</p>
      <p>8.4 Voice protocol:
        <span class="mono">"Overwatch set, lane [direction, landmark]. Trigger: hostile movement."</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Article 9: Use of Reaction Fire</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>9.1 Reaction fire is reserved for movement that threatens position, objective, or flank.</p>
      <p>9.2 Do not trigger overwatch on low-value distractions unless they compromise the line.</p>
      <p>9.3 Reaction fire should aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>9.3.1 Stop charges.</li>
        <li>9.3.2 Deny crossing of kill zones.</li>
        <li>9.3.3 Punish attempts to bypass or encircle the formation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>9.4 A missed overwatch shot is acceptable; a habit of firing without a clear kill objective is not.</p>
      <p>9.5 Overwatch operators are responsible for maintaining mental focus; boredom is not an excuse.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Your lane is your responsibility. Anything hostile that crosses it does so by your consent."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION V: AEGIS -->
    <h2>V. The Aegis Directives</h2>

    <p>
      A Codex warrior in a leadership or anchor role forms a Tactical Aegis—a radius of structured
      presence that stabilizes nearby allies. This is not mystical; it is the effect of consistency
      and unwavering composure under fire.
    </p>

    <h3>Article 10: Presence Under Fire</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>10.1 A Codex anchor does not visibly panic. Fear is addressed internally or in private after action.</p>
      <p>10.2 When giving orders, voice remains clear, paced, and free of uncontrolled shouting.</p>
      <p>10.3 Conflicting commands from multiple leaders are resolved by rank and mission clarity, not volume.</p>
      <p>10.4 An Aegis anchor is a visual and auditory stabilizer; they move with purpose, not flail with the flow.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Article 11: Influence Radius</h3>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>11.1 Allies within immediate radius of an Aegis are considered under their protection.</p>
      <p>11.2 Under Aegis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>11.2.1 Allies are expected to maintain formation and respond quickly to directives.</li>
        <li>11.2.2 Deviation or flight is judged more harshly than outside the Aegis, barring overwhelming conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>11.3 The collapse of morale near an Aegis anchor is investigated thoroughly.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Your calm is armor. Your consistency is a shield. Wear both before you wear plate."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION VI: EDICTS -->
    <h2>VI. The Codicier's Edicts</h2>

    <p>
      Edicts are doctrinal overrides. They are invoked sparingly and recorded meticulously.
      Each Edict represents a shift in priority: from balanced doctrine to focused response.
    </p>

    <h3>Edict of Purge</h3>
    <p>
      Applied when the continued existence of the enemy unit presents a risk disproportionate
      to any other concern: entrenched cults, summoners, siege crews, nodes of corruption.
    </p>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>12.1 Upon Purge, all fire discipline is bent toward maximum elimination of the target.</p>
      <p>12.2 Capture is deprioritized; intimidation is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>12.3 Collateral damage is accepted within the bounds declared pre-engagement or by higher authority.</p>
      <p>12.4 Purge is rescinded only when the target is neutralized or completely disengaged.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Edict of Fortify</h3>
    <p>
      Applied when the line must not break, regardless of enemy pressure and at significant risk to those holding it.
    </p>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>13.1 Upon Fortify, all movement is evaluated for defensive value first.</p>
      <p>13.2 Resource use prioritizes protection: cover, barriers, shield formation, suppression.</p>
      <p>13.3 Retreat is prohibited unless explicitly ordered as part of a structured fallback.</p>
      <p>13.4 Every casualty incurred under Fortify must be documented in terms of line preservation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Edict of Advance</h3>
    <p>
      Applied when time, ground, or objective requires aggressive forward motion, despite risk.
    </p>
    <div class="numbered">
      <p>14.1 Upon Advance, momentum is prioritized above comfort and minor losses.</p>
      <p>14.2 Units synchronize moves; isolated advance is not Advance, it is exposure and likely death.</p>
      <p>14.3 Fire discipline focuses on clearing paths and collapsing resistance along the vector.</p>
      <p>14.4 Advance continues until a new line is established or the objective is secured.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Purge clears. Fortify holds. Advance takes. Edicts exist so someone will decide what must happen now."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION VII: LIVING CODEX -->
    <h2>VII. The Living Codex</h2>

    <p>
      A Living Codex officer does not merely recite doctrine—they operationalize it under pressure.
      When conditions exceed the text, the Living Codex extends it.
    </p>

    <div class="numbered">
      <p>15.1 A Living Codex is known by decisions made when doctrine offers no clear answer.</p>
      <p>15.2 They maintain transparency: "I decided, for these reasons. If it was wrong, record it and correct it later."</p>
      <p>15.3 They accept consequence for decisions made under uncertainty; they do not displace blame downward.</p>
      <p>15.4 They understand that sometimes there is no good choice, only less catastrophic ones.</p>
      <p>15.5 Their loyalty is to mission, formation, and doctrine; not to ego or convenience.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Anyone can follow the Codex when it fits nicely. A Living Codex must act when every option is bad and the line still has to hold."
    </p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <!-- SECTION VIII: PRAYER & DRILL BOOK -->
    <h2>VIII. Codex Prayer & Drill Book</h2>

    <h3>1. Pre-Engagement Invocation</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "By Codex warrant, I stand.<br>
      By doctrine, I act.<br>
      Let my fire be controlled,<br>
      my judgment be cold,<br>
      my purpose be fixed.<br>
      I am the line. The line holds."
    </p>

    <h3>2. Breath Drill (Before Firing)</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Inhale order.<br>
      Exhale doubt.<br>
      Inhale the target.<br>
      Exhale the shot."
    </p>

    <h3>3. Overwatch Litany</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Movement in my lane is mine to judge.<br>
      Hesitation is failure.<br>
      I see. I choose. I fire."
    </p>

    <h3>4. After-Action Reflection</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "Review the breach.<br>
      Note every failure.<br>
      Correct what can be corrected.<br>
      Accept what cannot.<br>
      Carry neither excuse nor self-pity."
    </p>

    <h3>5. Rite for the Fallen</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "One asset lost.<br>
      Cost noted.<br>
      Lessons recorded.<br>
      Memory retained.<br>

    <!-- SECTION IX: OATH -->
    <h2>IX. The Codex Oath</h2>

    <p>
      Sworn at formal induction as a full operative of the Order. This oath defines the mental
      contract between warrior and doctrine.
    </p>

    <h3>The Oath of the Codex</h3>
    <p class="codex-quote">
      "I swear by the Codex-Lex:<br>
      I will place mission above comfort,<br>
      formation above glory,<br>

      I will not abandon my post,<br>

      Where I stand, order stands.<br>

      <li><strong>Mission First:</strong> Personal drama is postponed until debrief, not indulged mid-engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Hold the Line:</strong> You are an anchor, not driftwood.</li>
      <li><strong>Directive Clarity:</strong> Orders must be understandable in the chaos of combat.</li>
      <li><strong>No Excuses:</strong> There are reasons and there are corrections. Excuses are neither.</li>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An open, stylized book: the Codex itself—record of procedures, not myth.</li>
      <li>A vertical spear or bolt bisecting the book: doctrine applied as directed force.</li>

      <li>Color coding:
        <ul>
          <li>Deep blue: discipline, resolve.</li>
          <li>Iron grey: structure, hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Dim gold: authorized command under doctrine.</li>

    <!-- SECTION XII: DAILY REGIMEN -->
    <h2>XII. Personal Rituals & Daily Regimen</h2>

    <p>
      The daily routines of a Codex warrior are not ceremony. They are preventative maintenance on

    <ul>
      <li>Static posture drills in firing stance for set durations, increasing weekly.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Midday Cycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Full weapon strip, clean, and reassembly (timed, accuracy prioritized over speed at first).</li>
      <li>Field-of-fire exercises: mapping imaginary enemy vectors in any given space.</li>
      <li>Brief doctrinal review with peers: case studies, battlefield scenarios, failure analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evening Cycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>After-action mental replay of recent engagements or drills.</li>
      <li>Documentation or verbal listing of three mistakes and three correct actions.</li>
      <li>Selection of one habit to improve; implementing a correction plan by the next cycle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weekly Rite</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-etching or repainting of personal sigils, checking for battle damage.</li>
      <li>Public reading of a chosen Codex section for junior ranks or civilians under protection.</li>
      <li>Confirmation of command structures, fallback positions, and signal protocols.</li>

    <!-- SECTION XIV: CODEX CREED -->
    <h2>XIV. The Codex Creed</h2>

    <p>
      Short maxims suitable for battle, training, or introspection. These phrases are repeated until they
      surface automatically in moments of stress.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>"Order in all engagements."</li>
      <li>"We are not heroes. We are necessary."</li>
      <li>"Doctrine over impulse."</li>
      <li>"If one holds, all hold."</li>
      <li>"The objective does not care how you feel."</li>
      <li>"A broken line is a broken world."</li>
      <li>"Calm is my armor. Clarity is my shield."</li>
      <li>"I am the line. The line holds."</li>
    </ul>

      This concludes the core Codex-Lex tactical manual. Local annexes, weapon manuals, and operational
      supplements may be issued under Codicier authority. Unauthorized alteration or partial application
      of doctrine is considered a breach and will be corrected in training, or, if necessary, on the field.
